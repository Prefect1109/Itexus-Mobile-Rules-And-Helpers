# Git Requirements


## Working in a branch

### Features
Work on each feature takes place in a separate branch. The name of the branch is constructing by this rule: **feature/XXX-123-Name-Of-Task**, where **XXX** is a project identifier and **123** is a task number in Jira.

### Bugs
The name of the branch is constructing by this rule: **bugfix/XXX-123-Name-Of-Bug**, where **XXX** is a project identifier and **123** is a task number in Jira.
Bugs could be fixed together, without creating a separate pull request for each bug. But this could be applied only if the bug is small. All huge bugs should be in a separate branch.
In this case, a branch can be named just bugfixes.

### Commits
Giving title and description for commit is at your discretion, but you should stick to the rule: there is a limit of *80* symbols in a commit's name and *300* symbols in commit's description.

## Git flow

### Types of branches

**master/main** -  Branch for releases. All commits are merging into this branch only when the next version of the application is submitted to the AppStore. You should leave a proper tag on each commit in this branch (for example Version 1.3.10 Build 2). 

**develop** - Branch for development. There're two scenarios for changes to appear on this branch.
In the first scenario, all features and bugfixes are merging directly into this branch. So branch is updating several times a week at a minimum and holds the actual state of the application.
In the second scenario, all features and bugfixes are merging into the sprint branch to which they belong. After the end of the sprint, this branch is merging into develop. So if there are no hotfixes, the develop branch is updating once in two/three weeks, depending on the duration of the sprint, and contains the stable version of the application, with the features from the past sprint.
Hotfixes can be committed directly into the develop and can be pushed to the sprint branches via cherry-pick or rebase. 

**sprint_x** - Branch for development, where x - number of the current sprint. In the second scenario, which is listed above, this branch is using as the main branch for development until the sprint ends. After the end of the sprint, this branch should be merged into develop and removed from the history.

**feature/XXX-123-Some-Name** - Branch for feature development. All work on a task is going inside this branch. When the work is done, a developer should create a pull request. When the pull request is approved, this branch should be merged into sprint or develop using squash and removed from the history.
