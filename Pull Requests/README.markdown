# The Official Itexus Mobile Pull Requests Guide.

We're using pull requests to enhance code cleanliness and codebase understandability for all of our Mobile team members. After creating a pull request you need to notify the rest of the team by posting a Slack message in #pull-request channel. For standardizing the flow of reviewing, we use 8 rules

## Rules

1. Divide big tasks into small subtasks. It helps reviewers to focus on a small part of code and guarantees better verification.
2. Describe shortly what you did in a task or a subtask.
3. Attach a screenshot, that describes what was changed in the task.
4. When you're adding two reviewers (you should choose them by yourself), preferably one of them should have the rights to merge your request.
5. Correct your mistakes only after reviewers have ended the view of code.
6. Click on the checkbox "Close branch".
7. Delete all messages in chat associated with your request after the merge.
8. After review, if code is solid and you approved it, add :+1: under the message. If there are any comments from you add :eyes:.
