# The Official Itexus Mobile Pull Requests Guide.

Pull requests rules had created for more faster and comfortable understand which changes in code. In our team we use Slack for creating pull request messages. There are only 8 rules.

## Rules

1. Divide big tasks into small subtasks. It helps reviewers to focus on a small part of code and guarantees better verification.
2. To describe shortly what you did in task or subtask.
3. Attach a screenshot, that describes what changed in the task.
4. To add two reviewers on your view, preferably one of there has rights for merge your request.
5. Correct your mistakes only after reviewers ended the view of code.
6. Indicate in your request need to close branch.
7. Delete all messages in chat associated with your request after the merge.
8. After view, if code perfects and approve, add :+1: under the message. If some mistakes add :eyes:.
